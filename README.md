# Online-Textbooks
Online Textbooks is a web application where students can find relative study materials online such as textbooks and reference books instead of owning a physical copy. The web application consists of a repository of textbooks in a digital format relative to the studentâ€™s field of study. It eliminates the need for physical textbooks and materials not being available to the students of a particular class. It can also be easily accessed from anywhere within the boundaries of the institution and only by the stakeholders of the institution.

- With a vast repository of books, students and professor can access digital copies   anywhere and anytime.
